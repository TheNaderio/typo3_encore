TYPO3 integration with Webpack Encore!
======================================

This extension allows you to use the `splitEntryChunks()` feature
from [Webpack Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend.html)
by reading an `entrypoints.json` file and helping you render all of
the dynamic `script` and `link` tags needed.

```
composer require ssch/typo3-encore
```

## How to use

1. First of all install Webpack Encore as stated in the [documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend.html).
You should really be able to use all of the things described in the documentation.
Like Sass-Loader, Vue-Loader etc. These things are completely independent from this little extension.

You can also use the enableVersioning() of files (mostly used only in production context).  
Due to a hook for the ResourceFactory we make a lookup of file paths in the manifest.json and if it matches return the versioned path instead.

You can also use the enableIntegrityHashes(). This is taking into account if the files are included.

2. Define your entry path(s) and the output path (usually your Resource/Public/ folder in your Package extension) in the webpack.config.js

3. Afterwards set the two TypoScript constants to point to the manifest.json and the entrypoints.json located in the configured output folder
```php
plugin.tx_typo3encore {
    settings {
        entrypointJsonPath = EXT:typo3_encore/Resources/Public/entrypoints.json
        manifestJsonPath = EXT:typo3_encore/Resources/Public/manifest.json
    }
}
```
 
4. In your Page templates/layout you can then use the ViewHelpers to integrate the CSS- and JS-Files in your website
```html
{namespace e = Ssch\Typo3Encore\ViewHelpers}

<e:renderWebpackLinkTags entryName="app"/>
<e:renderWebpackScriptTags entryName="app"/>
```

If you have defined multiple entries you can define the desired entryName in the ViewHelpers
```html
{namespace e = Ssch\Typo3Encore\ViewHelpers}

<e:renderWebpackLinkTags entryName="secondEntryName"/>
<e:renderWebpackScriptTags entryName="secondEntryName"/>
```


Alternatively you can also include the files via TypoScript

```php
page.includeCSS {
    # Pattern typo3_encore:entryName
    app = typo3_encore:app 
}

page.includeJS {
    # Pattern typo3_encore:entryName
    app = typo3_encore:app
}

page.includeJSFooter {
    # Pattern typo3_encore:entryName
    app = typo3_encore:app
}
```

You donÂ´t have to care about including it only once. This will not happen during one request cycle unless you want to. 
=======
Note the prefix typo3_encore: This is important in order to render the files correctly.
You can then use all other known settings to include your files.

## Additional 

1. If you are in production mode and set enableVersioning(true) then you should set the option 

```php
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['versionNumberInFilename'] = ''
```
